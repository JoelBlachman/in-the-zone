VEX In The Zone Challenge Code

In this repository, I have uploaded all the files used to run Team 421 C's robot for the VEX In The Zone Challenge, 2017-2018.

Included are the main competition file, a function library, an autonomous routine, and a gyroscope library used to program
a gyroscope sensor on the robot.

As President of the Indian Hill Robotics Club and captain of Team 421 C, I led 2/3 teams to the Ohio VEX Championship, in 
which Team 421 C qualified for the semi-finals.

Unfortunately, we did not advance to the VEX World Championship as we did in the year before. However, we learned a great deal 
and were much better prepared to jump into the 2018-2019 season!
